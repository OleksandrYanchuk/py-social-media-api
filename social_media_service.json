This release, 3.12.0b3, is the third of four planned beta release previews of 3.12.\r\n\r\nBeta release previews are intended to give the wider community the opportunity to test new features and bug fixes and to prepare their projects to support the new feature release.\r\n\r\nWe strongly encourage maintainers of third-party Python projects to test with 3.12 during the beta phase and report issues found to [the Python bug tracker (https://github.com/python/cpython/issues) as soon as possible. While the release is planned to be feature complete entering the beta phase, it is possible that features may be modified or, in rare cases, deleted up until the start of the release candidate phase (Monday, 2023-07-31). Our goal is to have no ABI changes after beta 4 and as few code changes as possible after 3.12.0rc1, the first release candidate. To achieve that, it will be extremely important to get as much exposure for 3.12 as possible during the beta phase.\r\n\r\nPlease keep in mind that this is a preview release and its use is not recommended for production environments.",
